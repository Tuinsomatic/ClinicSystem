Note:
I'm not entirely sure what happened with my NetBeans, but I didn't have the build
options NB 8.2 should have! (I was using NB 8.2, not 11.2)! I've selected Login as 
my main class, built the project and created a .jar file (located in the target folder).

It should still run fine, though the folder structure is a little different.
